# Workspace
- Consists of 2 panes, of which the split can be repositioned.
- On the top right corner is the user avatar, which when clicked will provide user account related controls.
- On the top row, we have project settings, global settings etc. and clicking them will open the relevant settings windows.

## Right Pane
- The right half of the screen is where all the writing is done.
- There are blocks of text.
- Moving the cursor to the horizontal space of a block makes 2 buttons appear
- The first button is on the upper right corner of the block, which is the edit button, which makes the cursor go into the end of the block and enter input mode.
- The second button on the right of the block, vertically centered with the block, saves the block.
- After the block has been saved, the 2nd button turns into the "gather knowledge" button.
- After the knowledge has been gathered, that button is grayed out.
- When moving the mouse cursor outside the vertical space of the block, the buttons disappear.
- The "New Block" button will create a new block and immediately enter input mode.

## Left Pane
- This part works just like the left part of vs code in the default settings.
- The left pane has 2 parts, the selector in the left, and the viewer on the right.
- The selector can choose which functionality we want to see at the moment.
- The first button selects the story explorer, much like the file explorer in vs code, which is also the first button there. It displays the story in a hierarchy of chapters and scenes. Selecting a chapter displays the list of scenes. Selecting a scene displays that scene on the right pane.
- The unselected options will not be highlighted, also like vs code.
